abstract: >
  Discontinuation rates vary by family planning method and across socio-economic contexts. 
  Understanding these variations and their causes is paramount for developing and implementing policies aimed at curbing discontinuation rates. 
  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are ideal for obtaining this information, but this design can be extremely expensive and logistically complex. 
  The ongoing collection of comprehensive data sets, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS data), when combined with machine learning methods, present an alternative and relatively cost-effective means of evidence gathering for policy development. 
  Here, we use causal inference to estimate the effect of injectable contraceptive use on discontinuation over the 12-month period that follows its adoption. 
  To that aim, we use retrospective observational data from seven sub-Saharan African countries captured by the DHS’ Contraceptive Calendar. 
  We use machine learning methods to characterize data regions that share common covariate support. 
  We find that the use of injectables increased the risk of discontinuation in four of the seven countries analyzed. 
  Consistent with existing literature, we find that concerns with the side-effects of injectables appear to be the most frequent reason for discontinuation. 
  However, these risks decreased after adjusting for socio-economic factors. 
  As risk estimates may not apply uniformly within populations, we characterized the sub-populations for robust estimations by their geographical region, level of unmet needs, marital status, level of education, and age of first sex.
