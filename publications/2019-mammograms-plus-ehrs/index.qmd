  **Background**: Computational models on the basis of deep neural networks are increasingly used to analyze health care data. 
  However, the efficacy of traditional computational models in radiology is a matter of debate. \n
  **Purpose**: To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of a combined machine and deep learning approach for early breast cancer detection applied to a linked set of digital mammography images and electronic health records.
  **Materials and Methods**: In this retrospective study, 52 936 images were collected 
  in 13 234 women who underwent at least one mammogram between 2013 and 2017, 
  and who had health records for at least 1 year before undergoing mammography. 
  The algorithm was trained on 9611 mammograms and health records of women to make two breast cancer predictions: 
  to predict biopsy malignancy and to differentiate normal from abnormal screening examinations. 
  The study estimated the association of features with outcomes by using t test and Fisher exact test. 
  The model comparisons were performed with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or by using the DeLong test.
  **Results**: The resulting algorithm was validated in 1055 women and tested in 2548 women 
  (mean age, 55 years Â± 10 [standard deviation]). 
  In the test set, the algorithm identified 34 of 71 (48%) false-negative findings on mammograms. 
  For the malignancy prediction objective, the algorithm obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.93), 
  with specificity of 77.3% (95% CI: 69.2%, 85.4%) at a sensitivity of 87%. 
  When trained on clinical data alone, the model performed significantly better than the Gail model (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.54, respectively; P < .004).
  **Conclusion**: The algorithm, which combined machine-learning and deep-learning approaches, 
  can be applied to assess breast cancer at a level comparable to radiologists and has the potential to substantially reduce missed diagnoses of breast cancer.
