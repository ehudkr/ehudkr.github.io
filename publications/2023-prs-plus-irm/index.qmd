abstract: >
  Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are increasingly used to estimate the personal risk of a trait
  based on genetics.
  However, most genomic cohorts are of European populations, with a strong under-representation of non-European groups. 
  Given that PRS poorly transport across racial groups, this has the potential to exacerbate health disparities if used in clinical care. 
  Hence there is a need to generate PRS that perform comparably across ethnic groups.
  Borrowing from recent advancements in the domain adaption field of machine learning, 
  we propose FairPRS - an Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) approach for estimating fair PRS or debiasing a pre-computed PRS. 
  We test our method on both a diverse set of synthetic data and real data from the UK Biobank. 
  We show our method can create ancestry-invariant PRS distributions that are both racially unbiased and largely improve phenotype prediction.
  We hope that FairPRS will contribute to a fairer characterization of patients by genetics rather than by race.
