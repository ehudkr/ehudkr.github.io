My current research focus revolves mainly around causal inference.
Both applications (mainly around healthcare) and methodology (including usability).
I also dabble in information visualization and genetic-based risk models (polygenic risk scores).
Prior to that, I worked on computational methods in molecular biology (genomics and transcriptomics).
In addition to academic publications, I also issued several patents in the US.

I will do my best to keep this listing updated,
but in the plausible case I won't,
please see my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KAzt_pYAAAAJ&hl=en)
for the latest version.
