  INTRODUCTION
  Repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs could accelerate treatment development for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
  METHODS
  Using the MarketScan claims database (2011 to 2020), we applied a trial emulation approach in two base cohorts: (1) individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI cohort) and (2) individuals aged ≥70 years (over-70 cohort). We evaluated drugs represented in clinical trials for AD, comparing them with same-class or active comparators. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using inverse-probability-weighted Cox models.
  RESULTS
  A total of 6 out of 38 (16%) drugs in the MCI cohort and 10 out of 53 (19%) drugs in the over-70 cohort were associated with a lower AD incidence versus same-class comparators. Active comparator analyses indicated that bupropion (vs escitalopram; HR 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.49, 0.66]), trazodone (vs sertraline; HR 0.82, 95% CI [0.74, 0.91]), venlafaxine (vs escitalopram; 0.72, 95% CI [0.62, 0.84]), and zolpidem (vs lorazepam; HR 0.69, 95% CI [0.56, 0.85]) were associated with a lower AD incidence in the MCI cohort; these four plus liraglutide were associated with a lower incidence of AD dementia in the over-70 cohort (vs metformin; HR 0.74, 95% CI [0.59, 0.93]).
  DISCUSSION
  This is the first comprehensive set of trial emulations for FDA-approved drugs that are represented in AD trials. Findings may inform future trial designs.
