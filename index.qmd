Hi there! \
I'm a researcher and data scientist, 
currently part of the [Causal Machine Learning 
for Healthcare & Life Sciences group](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/analytics.shtml)
at [IBM Research, Israel](https://research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/). \
I speciliaze in causal inference, machine learning, (Bayesian) statistics, and data visualization.\
My work is mainly focused on the healthcare domain analyzing electornic health records and insurance claims records.\ 
I advocate for good software practices in research and academia, 
from data management to version control of analyses,
and I believe open software is key for a more reproducible, inclusive, and open science.

I'm the creator and maintainer of [`causallib`](https://github.com/IBM/causallib),
a one-stop shop Python package for flexible causal inference modeling.
