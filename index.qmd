Hi there! \
I'm a researcher and data scientist,
specilizing in causal inference, machine learning, (Bayesian) statistics, and data visualization.

I'm currently a Research Staff Member at [IBM Research, Israel](https://research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/),
in the [Causal Machine Learning for Healthcare & Life Sciences group](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/analytics.shtml).
There, I focus on answering policy questions in healthcare 
using electornic health records and insurance claims records.
I'm also the creator and maintainer of [`causallib`](https://github.com/IBM/causallib),
a one-stop shop open-source Python package for flexible causal inference modeling.
