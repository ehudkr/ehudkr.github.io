Hi there! \
I'm a researcher and data scientist,
specializing in causal inference, machine learning, (Bayesian) statistics, and data visualization.

I'm currently a **Research Staff Member** at **IBM Research**, Israel
in the [Causal Machine Learning for Healthcare & Life Sciences group](https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/analytics.shtml).
There, I focus on high-throughput causal inference 
for finding new indications for existing drugs
using electronic health records and insurance claims data.
I'm also the creator and maintainer of **[`causallib`](https://github.com/IBM/causallib)**,
a one-stop shop open-source Python package for flexible causal inference modeling.

#### Education
I have a BSc and MSc in Computer Science and Computational Biology 
from the Hebrew University. 
I did my Master's thesis with [Dr. Shai Carmi](https://scarmilab.org/) 
studying prediction of traits using DNA and its potential effect on
selecting embryos for implantation in IVF (aka "designer babies")
[{{< iconify bi journal-text >}}](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31210-3). \
Previous to that I was an undergraduate research associate in 
[Prof. Hanah Marglit's lab](http://margalit.huji.ac.il/), 
developing methods for finding novel protein-RNA interactions
using RNAseq data 
[{{< iconify bi journal-text >}}](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/19/10380/5064785).
